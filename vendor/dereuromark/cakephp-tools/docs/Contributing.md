# Contributing

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

I am looking forward to your contributions. There are several ways to help out:
* Write missing testcases
* Write patches for bugs/features, preferably with testcases included

There are a few guidelines that I need contributors to follow:
* Coding standards (`composer cs-check` to check and `composer cs-fix` to fix)
* Passing tests (you can enable travis to assert your changes pass) for Windows and Unix (`php phpunit.phar`)
