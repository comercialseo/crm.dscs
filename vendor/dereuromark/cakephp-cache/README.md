CakePHP 3.x version.

## What is it for?
It is the successor of the 2.x CacheHelper and allows you to cache your complete views as HTML.
No dynamic parts anymore, just complete static content ready to be delivered.
If you don't want to set up ESI and other third party caching software, this CakePHP only approach
does the job.

It uses a Middleware and a Component.
Why not a helper anymore? Mainly because a helper is too limited and would
not be able to cache serialized views, e.g. JSON, CSV, RSS content which have been build view-less.
