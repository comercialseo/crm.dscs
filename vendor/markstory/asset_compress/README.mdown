Asset Compress is CakePHP plugin for helping reduce the number of requests, and optimizing the remaining requests your application makes for Javascript and CSS files.

### Features

* Development mode builder that rebuilds assets on each request.
* Command line build tool to compile static assets for deployment.
* Built-in support for LESScss, Sass and CoffeeScript, as well as several
  minifiers.
* Powerful and flexible filter system allowing you to add your own
  minifiers/pre-processors.
* Simple configuration file.
* Incremental builds that don't recompile assets when they don't need to
  be.
