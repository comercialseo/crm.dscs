3.0.0 Changes

### Breaking Changes

* Dynamic build files and all features related to them have been removed.
  Dynamic build files presented a few challenges around maintenance and went
  against my goals of creating a fast and simple way to integrate all your
  asset pipeline features into one plugin.
* Prefixes on build files have been removed. In previous versions if you
  started a build file with `js_` or `css_`, these prefixes would be removed
  and used as the file suffix. You must now always include the file extension
  in the build target.
* New `inlineCss` and `inlineScript` methods were added to the
  AssetCompressHelper. These new methods allow you to inline js/css
  on the page. Note that the assets will be rebuilt on each page request.

### Other Changes

* Adopted PSR-2
